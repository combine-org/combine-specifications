# Synthetic Biology Open Language Data Model

![SBOL logo](./files/sbol2017.png) 

SBOL The Synthetic Biology Open Language Data (SBOL Data) Model is an open standard designed to facilitate the exchange and storage of genetic designs. Through its core data model, SBOL aims to allow researchers to unambiguously share information about the structure and intended behavior of designed biological constructs.

## Normative definitions
SBOL data is defined in a set of specification documents that describe the elements of the language, its syntax, and validation rules.

The latest specifications are:

* [The Synthetic Biology Open Language Data Model, version 2.2.0](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications:sbol-version-2.2.0)
* [The Synthetic Biology Open Language Data Model, version 2.1.0](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications:sbol-version-2.1.0)
* [The Synthetic Biology Open Language Data Model, version 2.0.1](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications:sbol-version-2.0.1)
* [The Synthetic Biology Open Language Data Model, version 2.0.0](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications:sbol-version-2.0.0)
* [The Synthetic Biology Open Language Data Model, version 1.1.0](https://identifiers.org/combine.specifications:sbol-version-1.1.0)

## Governance
SBOL Data development is coordinated by an [editorial board and the chair](http://sbolstandard.org/gov/) elected by the community.

## Communication
SBOL data development is executed by the SBOL Developers Group through discussion on the group mailing list, in virtual meetings, and at biannual in-person workshops.

To join the SBOL Developers Group, contact the [SBOL Editors](sbol-editors@googlegroups.com).

## Software support
Many software tools support SBOL data, including [SBOL APIs](http://sbolstandard.org/software/libraries/), [SBOL Converter/Validator tools](http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/sbol-validator/) and [end user software supporting SBOL Data](http://sbolstandard.org/software/tools/).

## History
A significant issue in synthetic biology is the difficulty in reproducing published synthetic designs. This prompted the development of SBOL to be started in 2007/2008. SBOL allows researchers and engineers to unambiguously exchange synthetic biology designs, that includes at the core the ability to describe a design in terms of DNA. Extensions permit other information to be represented. The language is based on RDF/XML. XML was chosen since it allows schemas to be specified and permits easier integration with other standards. SBOL also allows users to integrate existing biological information, such as the use of existing ontology terms for genetic design components.

SBOL was initially announced under the name “PoBoL” (Provisional BioBrick Language) in 2008 as a result of seed funding from Microsoft. SBOL version 1.0.0 was published in 2011, and includes the ability to specify hierarchical genetic designs, either partial or complete. SBOL was updated to version 1.1.0 in 2012.

The development of SBOL 2.0 is currently underway. To join the discussion, contact the [SBOL Editors](file:///sbol-editors%40googlegroups.com).
